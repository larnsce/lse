Itâ€™s from April 2013 and contains an opening post for my personal blog. I spare you pasting the text here, but it had me realize that this wish of writing online has been with me for quite a while. About 20 years ago, I actually learned some HTML and programmed a small website with photos of school events (and parties that we had way too early). Still, I will also spare you the details of that. Instead, let me say: Hello, I am excited to see you here.\n\n\n\n",
