## Well, hello `r emo::ji("wave")`

So, this is my blog. Last week, I stumbled over an MS Word file on an old hard drive. It's from April 2013 and contains an opening post for my personal blog. I spare you pasting the text here, but it had me realize that this wish of writing online has been with me for quite a while. About 20 years ago, I actually learned some HTML and programmed a small website with photos of school events (and parties that we had way too early). Still, I will also spare you the details of that. Instead, let me say: Hello, I am excited to see you here.
