I am an environmental engineer at heart and trade. My passion for it brought me 
to research within the global water, sanitation and health (WASH) sector. 
In 2016 I was introduced to R, which renewed my fascination for using 
programming to solve problems. I am driven by the unique opportunity to bring 
his two worlds together by teaching Data Science R using the values and 
principles at the core of its community.
