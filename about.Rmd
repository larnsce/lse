I realise that I should add some text here. And I will, one by one, as I develop an understanding what this website is about.

## What I know now (2020-02-14)

This website is about:

- actually using this URL that I have had for nearly 25 years
- providing a central place for my online profiles
- sharing how I develop R training courses
- blogging about my experience working in the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector
- my experience being a dad
- sharing my passions
