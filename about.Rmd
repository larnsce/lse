I realise that I should add some text here. And I will, one by one, as I develop an understanding what this website is about.

# `r emo::ji("light_bulb")` What I know now

This website is about

- actually using this URL that I have had for nearly 25 years
- providing a central place for my online profiles
- sharing how I develop R training courses
- blogging about my experience working in the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector
- my experience being a dad
- sharing my passions

# `r emo::ji("sunflower")` Thank you notes 

This site was build with R packages 
[{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and 
[{postcards}](https://github.com/seankross/postcards). I have followed [this
great tutorial](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2020-12-22-postcards-distill/) 
tutorial by @apreshill. 

# ðŸ“Š Web analytics

I am currently on a 30 day trial with [plausible.io](https://plausible.io/),
which claims to be a [privace focused Google Analytics alternative](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics). 
It's [open source](https://github.com/plausible/analytics) and provides some
basic analytics. I share my stats [publicly](https://plausible.io/lse.de.).
