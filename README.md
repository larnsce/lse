# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome 

This is my personal website. It's main purpose is to provide a landing page for
my online profiles, and CV. I intend to also use this website as a blog, 
but will have to first get a writing habit going, so won't promise anything 
right now.

# ðŸŒ» Thank you notes 

This site was build with R packages 
[{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and 
[{postcards}](https://github.com/seankross/postcards). I have followed [this
great tutorial](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2020-12-22-postcards-distill/) 
tutorial by @apreshill. 

# ðŸ“Š Web analytics

I am currently on a 30 day trial with [plausible.io](https://plausible.io/),
which claims to be a [privace focused Google Analytics alternative](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics). 
It's [open source](https://github.com/plausible/analytics) and provides some
basic analytics. I share my stats [publicly](https://plausible.io/lse.de.).
